# methylpipeline
Wrapper for BWA aligner and IGV viewer for multi-sample methylation analysis

# Quick Start

1. Install dependencies below
2. Create a folder 'input' in the same folder as this script. This should contain n subfolders, with each subfolder containing FASTA files for analysis (typically 2 paired samples). These must have a .fastq extension.
3. Create a folder 'reference_genome'. Put a FASTA file here to be used as a reference - this should be called reference.fa by default.
4. Run the methyl_analysis.R script:

    Rscript methyl_analysis.R

Many outputs are created in the output/<sample_name> folder for each sample. These include:
* Alignment data, stored in .bam files. These will be loaded in IGV viewer automatically.
* Methylation summary as an Excel file. This is generated by direct analysis of the BAM alignment files and shows methylation data for all CpG islands.
* Methlation summary as a .bed file. This is generated using a SNP analysis technique, by the bwa-meth software. This only shows identified low frequency SNP sites.
* Heatmaps showing methylation status at CpG islands.
* Many other files which can be safely ignored.
